## Description
This is a collection of (mainly) Shell and Perl scripts, some more useful than
others, and including some redundancy, where I rewrote scripts in another
language. Most of the scripts were designed with personal use in mind and, as
such, don't include extensive documentation or sophisticated dependency / error
handling.

#### Noteworthy Scripts
* [`g`](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/blob/master/source/perl/g)
\- Compact syntax for frequently used git commands
* [`keemount`](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/blob/master/source/perl/keemount)
\- Mount drive using UUID (if not mounted already) and open KeePass kxdb-database
  * in development, not particularly feature-rich yet
* [`nff`](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/tree/master/source/shell/nff)
\- (Neo)Vim Fuzzy Finder (`nff -h | --help` for extensive information)
* [`sysload`](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/blob/master/source/perl/system_monitors/sysload)
(Perl) - Simple script for measuring CPU and memory utilization
