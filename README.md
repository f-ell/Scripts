## Description
This is a collection of (mainly) Shell and Perl scripts, some more useful than
others, and including some redundancy, where I rewrote scripts in another
language. Most of the scripts were designed with personal use in mind and, as
such, don't include extensive documentation or sophisticated dependency / error
handling.
