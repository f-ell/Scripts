## Description
This is a collection of (mainly) Shell and Perl scripts, some more useful than
others including some redundancy where I rewrote scripts in another language.
Most of the scripts were designed with personal use in mind and, as such, don't
contain extensive documentation or sophisticated dependency / error handling.

### Noteworthy Scripts
* [keemount](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/tree/master/source/perl/keemount)
\- mount drive using UUID and open KeePass kxdb-database from drive
  * in active development, not particularly feature-rich yet
* [nff](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/tree/master/source/shell/nff)
\- (Neo)Vim Fuzzy Finder (run `nff -h | --help` for further information)
* [sysload](https://gitlab.com/fell_/Scripts/-/blob/master/source/perl/system_monitors/sysload)
(Perl) - Simple, yet useful script for measuring CPU and memory utilization
